# Documentation and Resources

Welcome to the Leeman Geophysical LLC Knowledge Base. Here we have all of the
documentation, downloads, and resources you need to use your products from both
Leeman Geophysical and our OrangeEDU product lines. 

The knowledge base is split up into several main areas:

* [Product Documentation](products.md) contains all of the manuals and linked
  resources you need for using a product.

* [Application Notes](appnotes.md) has helpful resources that apply to more than
  one product or more general instructions and may be linked from individual
  product's documentation.

* [Downloads](downloads.md) lists all of the downloads available for our
  products, though relevant links are also provided in the product
  documentation.

* [Resources](resources.md) suggests other resources such as our YouTube channel
  and blog where there is useful information.

* [Support](support.md) helps you get ahold of our team to experience our quick
  and friendly help to get your questions answered.
