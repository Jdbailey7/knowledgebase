## Overview
The SMPL BNC Breakout makes it easy to connect any 4 pin SMPL connector to
anything else in the world with a BNC connector. This breakout features a
plastic shelled BNC to keep the connector isolated from a metal enclosure and
solder jumpers to allow you to connect any of the 4 SMPL pins to either the
inner or outer contacts of the BNC. Want to connect more than 1 SMPL pin? No
problem, just close multiple jumpers!

### What's in the Box

* SMPL BNC Breakout PCB Assembly

## Configuration 
There are a total 8 solder jumpers on the PCB assembly. These jumpers are found
in 2 rows and 4 columns where the columns **(A-D)** correspond to the pins of
the SMPL push connector, and the rows **I** and **O** relate to the 2
connections of the BNC connector. 

The **I** jumpers connect to the center pin of the BNC, and the **O** jumpers
connector to the outer contact. The grid of jumpers formed by the rows and
columns describe which two pins will be connected when a jumper is soldered
closed. This connector assembly remains isolated from the panel in which it is
mounted via the plastic housing of the connector. If it is desired to connect
the outer sleeve of the BNC to the panel, you can solder a wire to the small
through hole connection located by the jumper array on the circuit board. This
wire can then be connected to your panel or enclosure.
