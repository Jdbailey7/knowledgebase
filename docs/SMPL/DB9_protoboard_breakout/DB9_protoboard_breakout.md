## Overview
The DB9 Protoboard Breakout is the ideal solution for anyone working with DB9
cables and connectors. Featuring both male and female DB9 connectors, this PCB
breaks out each pin and the shell connection onto a row of solder pads, complete
with pin numbers for easy identification. The integrated prototyping area allows
you to create custom adapters, filters, injectors, or any other modifications
needed for signals traveling via a DB9 cable. This flexibility enables you to
build and modify circuits directly on the board, providing a tailored solution
for your specific signal requirements.  

Designed for ease of use and versatility, the DB9 Protoboard Breakout ensures
proper signal shielding and reliable performance. Once your customizations are
complete, the entire assembly can be heat-shrunk for a neat and professional
finish. Whether youâ€™re an engineer, technician, or hobbyist, this breakout board
is perfect for projects that require precise and stable signal handling. It also
serves as an excellent troubleshooting tool, making it a valuable addition to
any toolkit.
