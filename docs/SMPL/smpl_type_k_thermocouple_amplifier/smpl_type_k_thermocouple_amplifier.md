## Overview
Expand your temperature measurement capabilities with the new SMPL Thermocouple
Amplifier, specifically designed to integrate seamlessly into the SMPL system.
This advanced amplifier converts the tiny voltages produced by Type K
thermocouples into a clean, linear analog output that is easy to record and
interpret over a wide temperature range.

Ideal for systems already utilizing analog-to-digital converters for other
process measurements, the SMPL Thermocouple Amplifier offers precise temperature
monitoring, ensuring your processes are running optimally. Whether you’re in an
industrial setting or a research environment, this amplifier provides the
accuracy and reliability you need.
