## Overview
The SMPL DB9 Breakout allows the total configuration of connections between a
female or male DB9 connector to the 4 pins of our SMPL connector. This enables
you to effortlessly connect any DB9 to any 4-pin SMPL device, expanding
compatibility across your equipment. These Universal DB9 Breakouts utilize an
array of solder jumpers to configure a SMPL four position push connector to any
of the desired pins on a DB9. There are additional jumpers that allow you to
connect any of the DB9 Pins to the case ground without utilizing a pin of the 4
position connector. We have recommended pinouts for many types of sensors in the
[SMPL documentation](../smpl_standard.md), so donâ€™t forget to check those out.

## Configuration 
There are a total 45 solder jumpers on the PCB assembly. These jumpers are found
in 5 rows and 9 columns where the rows <b>(A-D)</b> correspond to the pins of the
SMPL push connector, and the columns <b>(1-9)</b> relate to the 9 pins of the D-Sub
connector. The row and the column then describe the which two pins the jumper
will connect when soldered. Multiple pins on the D-Sub can be connected to the
same output pin if desired. The additional row of jumpers <b>(S)</b> serve to
connect pins from the DB9 directly to the casing of the D-Sub connector.
